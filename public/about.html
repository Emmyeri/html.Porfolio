  the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>

  Seminary Social Club allowed me to contribute to my community by providing essential first aid services and training. 
  Additionally, my tenure as a Sales Associate at Vido Exchange in Prague, Czech Republic, equipped me with valuable sales 
  and customer service skills.</p>
